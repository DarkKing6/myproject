            <h2>Mordecai</h2>
            <p>
              Mordecai is one of the main protagonists (alongside Rigby) of Regular Show. He made his debut in the non-canon short "2 in the AM PM" as a human cashier, who then morphs into a prototype Mordecai-like character with a fanny pack. He later makes his first official appearance in the Pilot episode.

After the dramatic ending with Pops' defeat over Anti-Pops, in which he sacrifices himself to save the universe, Mordecai finally parts ways with Rigby, and he becomes an abstract artist, marries a batgirl named Stef, whom he meets at a gallery and has 3 children with.

Mordecai is voiced by the show's creator, J.G. Quintel.
<hr>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<h5>Early Life and Embarrassments</h5> 
<p>He and Rigby have been friends since they were babies. They sometimes hang out with each other along with Rigby's younger brother, Don. Mordecai had many embarrassing moments during his life, especially with his mother who embarrassed him in front of girls he invited to his house and record his embarrassing moments. He is also an artist although he failed in portrait art as the art he drew was terrible that the girl he drew cried and running away. It made worse with Sad Sax Guy giving wrong advice in his art.</p>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Appearance</h3> 
            <p>The upper portion of his head, wings, tail feathers and back are mostly blue, while the lower portion of his head and chest are white (and a few times pale-blue) with a faint, blue line down the length of his chest. A thick, curved black marking is on each side of his head, around where his ears would be.Two white lines are found on both of his wings with two thinner, black lines on each of his fingers and one stripe of each of his thumbs, and three tail feathers, each with two black stripes. Mordecai's legs are grey with black stripes across the width and two toes. Like most blue jays, he has curved, crested blue feathers, or "hair", on his head. Mordecai almost never wears clothes, except on special occasions, and he wouldn't wear them for an entire episode, or he'll only wear a shirt and no pants, similar to Rigby. For a list of the outfits and appearances Mordecai has had throughout the series, see Mordecai's Alternate Outfits

              When he was five or six years old, he had buck teeth and didn't have the black stripes on his tail feathers or fingers. As a baby, he still did not have the stripes on his tail feathers or fingers, and he only had one white stripe on each of his arms, as seen in "Terror Tales of the Park II", although his baby self was seen with stripes on his fingers in "Maxin' and Relaxin".
              
              When he was in his pre-teen and teenage years, he had brown hair and braces. In "A Skips in Time", "Rigby in the Sky With Burrito", and "Regular Show: The Movie", high school Mordecai was seen wearing a white t-shirt with a red collar and sleeve cuffs with the words "Brain Explosion", the name of his favorite band, written on the front, with grey jeans and red sneakers. In his possible late teens, Mordecai's brown hair was long and at one point covered his eyes.
              
              During the time montage in the finale, Mordecai, now a few years older, is first seen with a bit of stubble on his chin and wearing t-shirts, first a white t-shirt, and then a green t-shirt. Later in the montage, an older Mordecai is shown to be somewhat a little heavier, with hair on his chest and more stubble on his face, and he is wearing thick light green glasses and a light green collared shirt. 25 years in the future, at the 25-year park reunion, Mordecai (now 48-54) is shown with a brown beard and thick black glasses, and he is wearing a red hoodie over a light grey shirt and a purple beanie. He also has a gold wedding ring.</p>
              <hr><h3>Personality</h3>

              <p>Mordecai is mild-mannered, laid-back, and big-hearted. Like Rigby, he lacks clothing, plays video games, sings karaoke, and drinks copious amounts of coffee and soda. Of the duo of two main characters, Mordecai displays far more patience, responsibility, and intelligence than Rigby does. Although almost every problem caused by the duo is Rigby's fault, Mordecai does cause problems at times, though they are unrelated to work. An example is in "The Unicorns Have Got to Go" when Mordecai tries to attract Margaret with DudeTime but ends up attracting a group of ill-mannered, lazy, and irresponsible unicorns that wreak havoc. Mordecai puts up with Rigby's laziness and immaturity, once even filling out a job application for Rigby because he claimed it was "boring." Mordecai tends to be more sociable, friendly and serious than Rigby and has much more manageable relationships with others. Although Mordecai naturally despises work, he strives to keep a good reputation, once almost losing his life to avoid being labeled as a slacker, and vouching for extra work to pay for concert tickets. Unlike Rigby, Mordecai doesn't talk about or openly express himself or his feelings. Therefore, Mordecai's most obvious shortcoming is his inability to engage his love interests by speaking his heart. Whenever he was around his crush, Margaret, he would often stutter or lose focus. In spite of this, he often made up excuses to go to The Coffee Shop just to see her. He is a serious person and wants people to do the right thing. It is also proven that he is fond of the word "dude" and the saying "OOOOOOOH!," as he and Rigby often exclaim, although they do stop saying this when they get older as seen in the finale.</p>
              <hr> <h3>Skills/Habits</h3>
          
          <p>Mordecai has shown a variety of abilities and habits—both good and bad—throughout the series. 
            <ul>
  <li>Artist- In "Camping Can Be Cool", it was revealed that Mordecai went to art school, but in "Fool Me Twice" it was revealed that Mordecai dropped out. In "Bad Portrait" it was revealed he had bad portrait skills. In a flashback, he tried to draw a lady, and the resulting picture was so bad, that she ran away crying, ruining his confidence in art. Another time was when he was failing sculpture, and his friend Sad Sax Guy advised him to make a sculpture of his instructor's "human form". However, that too was a disaster. Despite this, as shown when he made a great portrait of Benson, he is actually a good artist. After the series finale, he becomes a famous artist with his own art gallery.</li>
  <li>Leadership - Mordecai has some notable leadership skills, as displayed in many episodes, such as "Exit 9B."</li>
  <li>Video Game Master - Mordecai is an expert at video games. Anytime Mordecai and Rigby play against each other, Mordecai would win every time (except in "It's Time" because of Rigby's constant bragging about going out with Margaret, "Jinx," and "Bet to Be Blonde" when Rigby cheats and unplugs Mordecai's controller). Mordecai is always player one, except at the end of "Death Punchies".</li>
  <li>Educated - Mordecai is both figuratively and literally smarter than Rigby in nearly every possible way. He has mentioned to have acquired not only a high school diploma, which Rigby doesn't have (as mentioned in the episode "More Smarter"), but also a college education (although, in "Fool Me Twice", Rigby said that Mordecai never graduated). However, he was outwitted by Rigby when the latter got him to drink "RigJuice".
  <li>Skilled Liar - In "Grilled Cheese Deluxe", Mordecai showed great aptitude for lying. He competed against Rigby to prove who was the better liar and ultimately emerged victorious. Near the end of the episode, he lied to Benson about what happened to his sandwich in which Benson believed over Rigby's truth.</li>
  <li>Truthful - Mordecai is not only a skilled liar, but he is also very truthful. For example, in "The Power", Mordecai instantly admitted what happened to Skips when Benson asked him.</li>
  <li>Skilled at Staring - Mordecai has shown that he can go hours into a staring contest. He did so against Peeps in the episode of the same name and won, even though he couldn't blink after the contest and had to go to the hospital.</li>
  <li>Guitar Player - In "This Is My Jam" and "Return of Mordecai and the Rigbys", he was shown to have increased his skill at playing the guitar, unlike in "Mordecai and the Rigbys", where neither Rigby or himself knew how to work the instrument.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Strength - This greatly varies from episode to episode, though he is always seen to be much stronger than Rigby. This is notable when the two engage in a game of Punchies. However, while not on Skips' or Muscle Man's level, there are several instances where Mordecai possesses well-above-average strength, as he has on these occasions bashed his way through locked doors ("Just Set Up the Chairs"). In fact, he is so strong that he can break a broom with one punch and easily rip a shirt as shown in "Mordecai and the Rigbys". However, his most recent and impressive feat of physical strength is shown when he bashed Death Bear across a room and through a wall in the episode of the same name.</li>
  <li>Coffee Drinker - Mordecai is often seen with coffee, more so than Rigby. In "Free Cake", the episode starts with Mordecai supposedly drinking from a half-full pot of coffee. In "Mordecai and the Rigbys", Mordecai starts out with a cup of coffee in his hands when Rigby enters the Coffee Shop.</li>
  <li>Speeches - Mordecai tends to persuade people when he gives talks and speeches. Examples are sen in "Don" when Mordecai persuades Rigby to confront and mend Rigby's relationship with his brother; "Rage Against The TV", when Mordecai tells Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost to help with beating the Hammer; in "Muscle Woman", when he talks to Starla, unintentionally infatuating her; and in "Mordecai and the Rigbys", when Mordecai tries to tell the crowd about being tricked into lip-synching. Another example would be when Mordecai apologizes to CJ to calm her down in "Yes Dude Yes". Also, he gave a protest speech to Margaret being trapped in the Voice Messaging Control Center in "Butt Dial", begging her not to play the message that contained the song Mordecai made up about how it would be like if they were together forever. However, it didn't work. He is also shown to give a great speech in "Exit 9B", which Garrett Bobby Ferguson Jr. claimed touching. In "Do or Diaper ", he explained to Margaret about the bet, and admitted that he likes her.</li>
  <li>Kind-Hearted - Mordecai possesses social skills that an immature Rigby doesn't. Mordecai has better relations with his friends and has never really shown many harsh feelings toward them. He always tries to settle disagreements. He also admitted a certain secret to save his life. The only major time he wasn't kind-hearted was in "It's Time" when he pushed Rigby off of a microwave, killing him, though it was out of anger, and he was immediately regretful of his actions.</li>
  <li>Music Lover and Singer - Mordecai has shown on several occasions that he can sing very well. In "Mordecai and the Rigbys", "Karaoke Video", and "Butt Dial" he sings nice and clear, although he tends to be off-key. Also, he seemed to know about a band called Brain Explosion that Rigby didn't know about in "This Is My Jam". He also once listened to a song on repeat for five days in "Yes Dude Yes". He can also come up with song lyrics on the spot, as demonstrated when he and Rigby rap with each other, such as in "Party Pete" and especially "Silver Dude". Additionally, he can play the saxophone, since he was in a jazz band in high school.</li>
  <li>Skilled Fighter - Mordecai is very good at fighting others, as seen in many episodes. Examples are Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost in "The Night Owl", Chad and Jeremy in "Replaced", Carrey O'Key and Carl in "Karaoke Video" and The "Family" "Restaurant" people in "Out of Commission ". He is also skilled in the powerful martial arts of Death Kwon Do and can perform many amazing techniques when wearing the proper attire.</li>
  <li>Party Animal - In "Party Pete", "See You There", and some other episodes, it shows that Mordecai really likes to party.</li>
  <li>Sanitation - Even though Mordecai is a party animal, he is good at cleaning up major parties. This is shown in "Replaced", "Butt Dial", "Party Pete", etc.</li>
  <li>Snoring - It is seen in "Ello Gov'nor" that he snores when he sleeps.</li>
  <li>Ladies Man - Despite the fact he has a crush on Margaret, he has earned attention of Starla from "Muscle Woman", CJ, and his 12 dates from "Yes Dude Yes" (though Rigby was the one who set him up for it), possibly Ladonna from "Access Denied". A woman from "Do or Diaper" gives him her phone number when Mordecai was practicing his kissing.</li>
  <li>Skilled Rapper- Along with Rigby, he is shown on occasions such as "Rap It Up" and "Party Pete" rapping very well. They also tried to teach Pops how to rap in order to take on the CrewCrew to prepare him in their rap battle.</li>
  <li>Skilled Dancer - As seen in "TGI Tuesday", Mordecai is a skilled dancer, known famous for his "robot".</li>
  <li>Donut Master - Seen in "Carter and Briggs", wherein Mordecai along with Rigby practice the art of "donut driving", and eventually master it thanks to Muscle Man's tutelage. They also manage to win the contest in the episode.</li>
  <li>Skilled Driving - As shown many times in the show, Mordecai is shown to be a very good driver, especially in the golf cart. On many occasions, he is always shown to be the driver of the whole gang when in a chase scene. Also, he is able to make sharp turns, think fast, and be a match for many that are chasing him. The only person who could rival his skill is Thomas.</li>
  <li>Skilled Dodgeball Player - It is revealed in "Dodge This" he is quite an impressive dodgeball player, easily eliminating most of the Thunder Girlz until it was left to him and CJ. More information on this can be found on the episode page.</li>
  <li>Imaginative - Both Mordecai and Rigby seem to have an active imagination. They tend to have a lot of creative ideas, but as shown in "Video 101", they, unfortunately, lack a sense of when those ideas become too many, or when they are just simply over the top.</li>
  <li>Motorcycle Driving - In "Play Date", despite having some trouble in the beginning, he quickly learned how to ride a motorcycle from CJ when they were being chased by a bunch of angry demonic parents.</li>
  <li>Heimlich Manouvre Expert - Mordecai is shown to be skilled in using this technique to save people such as Muscle Man from choking a few times before without fail.</li>
  <hr><h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heavy Sleeper  - Throughout the entire show, Mordecai is shown to be the usual heavy sleeper, falling asleep very often. Rigby has gently shaken him to get him to wake up many times. (Examples: " Ello Gov'nor ", " This Is My Jam " and " Really Real Wrestling "). He also managed to sleep through being sent to Australia in " Mordecai and Rigby Down Under ".</li>
      <li>Slacker  - Mordecai and Rigby both have a tendency to slack off from work. Benson then yells at them to stop slacking off. This is seen in almost every episode.</li>
      <li>Lousy Swimmer  - It is implied in " Meat Your Maker " when the hot dogs put Skips, Pops, Benson and Mordecai to marinate, and he was practically drowning. However, this was shown to be false as he have competed against Frank in a diving contest in Family BB.</li>
      <li>Mordecai-ing -  Despite being a ladies man, he is very often seen being too nervous or scared to make the first move to express his true feelings. His reluctance to make the first move is notorious, that his name is often the term of chicken-ing out by his fellow friends, hence the term "Pulling a Mordecai." For example, in " Meteor Moves " he was reluctant to make the move that he almost ends up being friendzoned, and in " I Like You Hi ", he accidentally texted the aforementioned phrase to CJ and tried to come up with a convoluted plan to tell her the text was an autocorrect of "I like Yugi, which he admits he did because he was nervous to admit his feelings.</li>
      <li>Roller skating- In "Yes Dude Yes", Mordecai is shown to not be very good at roller skating, as his legs are shaking and he almost falls over when he and CJ go roller skating. However, in a later episode ("Bald Spot"), he goes roller-skating with Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen, and he roller skates just fine.</li>
      <li>Poor Navigation  - In " Survival Skills ", Mordecai seems to have a poor sense of direction, getting himself and Rigby lost in the middle of the woods and only to end up in the same place where they started. He even mentioned that he forgot where the golf cart was located.</li>
      <li>Generous to a Fault  - While he's not a complete pushover, Mordecai finds it hard to say no at times. In " 1000th Chopper Flight Party ", he did not object to getting in the helicopter with Margaret because he did not want to hurt the Smith family's feelings, despite the fact that there would be a chance that CJ would notice (and unfortunately, She did).</li>
      <li>Traitor  - as was shown in the episode "Trash Boat," he did not think twice about telling everyone that Rigby had changed his name to Trash Boat, making him the target of everyone's joking, an attitude that a true best friend would never have done. He also refused to give Rigby the money to change his name back just so he could continue to make fun of him (although Mordecai does help Rigby change his name back after their lives are put in danger)</li>
