<h3>Biography</h3>
<h5>Early Start</h5> 
<p>Skips (formerly known as Walks) is born somewhere in the 18th or 19th Century. During his teenage times, he gone many adventures with his friend, Techmo including going into a Timenado that takes him to the present. He is also been expelled from different high school for making fights and remain aloof from his record. In the latest school he joined, he is given a stern warning not to make fights in school or else he will be expelled again</p>
      </p>
      <h5>High School Tragedy</h5>
      <p>In 1814 He made friends with Gareth and the Guardians of Eternal Youth but got in trouble with Klorgbane as Klorgbane bully Walks' friends. As they were about to fight, the Headmaster intervenes but the fight between them isn't over. During his break, he sit with a classmate named Desdemona or Mona for short and made friends with her. However, she promptly left as Walks discuss with his friends on fighting Klorgbane because Mona dislike fighting. This cause Walks to not fight.

        Soon over school times, Walks relationship with Mona grew as Mona teach Walks many skills, go on dates and skip together. Meanwhile, the school is suffering under Klorgbane bully which Walks wants to intervene. However, if he fight Klorgbane, Mona will leave him and he will be expelled from school. Gareth console Walks that they will find a suitable time and location, but the time is the prom which Walks reluctantly agree due to the only time Klorgbane accepts.
        
        Walks bring Mona to the prom and have a party but was reminded by Gareth to join the fight. However, Klorgbane being impatient intercept the prom and challenge Walks for a fight. With Mona's blessing, Walks engage Klorgbane but the latter is immune to punches. His friends tried to help but was defeated. During the chaos, a rubble collapsed onto Mona and killing her in front of Walk's eyes. Gareth managed to bring the Fists of Justice to Walks, he uses it to fight Klorgbane effectively and punch him out to space. He went back to check on Mona but the only thing left is the necklace Walks gave to her. This devastated Walks as she was the only one he cared about.Years later, he is invited to the Guardians of Eternal Youth once more to makes Walks immortal as they need him to defeat Klorgbane who will come back every 157 years. The only condition is to change his name, Walks remember his old days with Mona and change his name to Skips. After that he becomes immortal, but he also have to perform a dance on his birthday to sustain his immortality. It also started to work on Mr Maellard's park once he is immortal, Skips worked on about 2 centuries before meeting with new park members like Benson, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost and finally Mordecai and Rigby.</p>

      <h3>Appearance</h3> 
<p>Skips is a yeti (standing at 6'5"), wearing only blue jeans with a brown belt. He closely resembles a gorilla. He has large muscles and abs, small hands, and eyes with yellowish sclera. He has white hair all over his body except for his hands, feet, chest area and his face. It is also revealed that he lost some of his hair, so he made a combover. He is 505 at the series' beginning and 512 at the end.

  Because he is immortal, Skips' appearance remained unchanged during the time montage and the Park's 25 year reunion, with the only difference being that he now wears cut jean shorts.</p>
        <hr><h3>Personality and Traits</h3>

        <p>He has an interesting and mysterious past due to his immortality. Everybody relies on him to solve supernatural problems, and he almost always has the answer. There have only been a few occasions where he didn't know what to do, such as in "Brain Eraser" when, although he knew how to delete Mordecai's memory of Pops' nudity, he didn't know how to exit the video tape. He also couldn't fix error 219 on Mordecai and Rigby's computer. In "Skunked", his best ideas (a shower and coffee) didn't work, and in "Sugar Rush" he said to give Pops more sugar to stop his sugar rush when this only made it worse. However, Rigby knew what to do by giving him the opposite of more sugar: Benson's whole wheat donut. Skips also admits that he doesn't know what's wrong with Rigby in "This Is My Jam ", and even goes so far as to give advice that indirectly worsens the situation.

          Skips is often quiet and is one of the least vocal characters of the show, spending the majority of his spare time working out in the golf cart garage which doubles as his home. Despite his monotone expressions, he can be seen having a good time joking around, such as in "This Is My Jam", where he jokes with Mordecai and Rigby that he knew everything, though admits afterwards that he only knew about their plan because he was "in the can" while they were talking about it. Skips has great self-esteem and pride in his knowledge and strength, once going so far as to kill Rigby when he beat Skips at arm wrestling.
          
          He is considerably friendly with the other groundskeepers, and seems to be good friends with Benson, convincing him to take a break in "Party Pete" due to the stress he was going through. Overall, he's always willing to assist anybody that needs him and his expertise, despite how annoyed with the situation he might be. Skips rarely ever walks or runs, but when he is punched in the face by the bouncer at Carrey O'Key's, he runs after his attacker, and throws him into a table, which breaks with the force of Carl/The Bouncer's weight and he walks while Benson is driving the cart to pull Rigby's head out of the black hole in "First Day".</p>
        <hr> <h3>Talents/Habits</h3>
    
      <ul>
<li>Strength - Skips is best known among his friends for his superior strength (e.g., punching open a punching bag in "Over the Top"). It was also evidenced in "Death Punchies" that he accidentally sent Rigby to the hospital by punching him too hard. And in the episode Caveman, he was shown to hold his own against a couple of cavemen before being knocked unconscious.</li>
<li>Skipping - Despite originally being named "Walks", Skips always skips, no exceptions. Hence, he changed his name to Skips. In the episode "Diary" it was revealed that he skips because he had a lover who skipped with him all the time. When he lost her he vowed to skip for the rest of his life so he could never forget the memories he had with her.</li>
<li>Self-Esteem - Skips is very self-assured, always enjoying being praised by his friends. However, when he loses his standing as the best at something, Skips becomes upset, adopting a single-minded determination until he is able to prove himself.</li>
<li>Eternal Youth - By being granted eternal youth by the Guardians of Eternal Youth, Skips is able to live indefinitely young in exchange for performing a spirit dance directed toward said guardians on his birthday. It is unlikely that he still performs his spirit dance since he arrived for his birthday party which occurred six months prior to the events in the episode Fists of Justice. Skips, after the events in the episode Free Cake, may no longer be required to perform the spirit dance to maintain his youth and immortality.</li>
<li>Knowledge - Due to Skips having immortality, he has seen many things in his past and has a strong knowledge of the unknown. He usually always has an answer to everything. However, in the episode Sugar Rush, Skips said that eating more sugar will slow everything down, but it only ends up sending his friends to a higher sugar plain instead. When they eat the whole wheat donut, it saved them, and Rigby proved Skips wrong.</li>
<li>Arm Wrestling - Skips is seen doing very well at arm wrestling in "Over The Top". He only lost to Rigby because he was cheating.</li>
<li>Bass Guitar Player - As seen in "This Is My Jam", Skips knows how to play the electric bass guitar.</li>
<li>Video games - Skips is an extremely adept gamer, playing with Mordecai in Video Game Wizards in a fighting games tournament in the place of Rigby. He performs with considerable technique and finesse, and upon being replaced by Rigby, leaves without arguing. When asked why, he expresses his gratefulness that Mordecai finally learned his lesson about gaming, and expressed that the game was "too easy anyway".</li>
<li>Bowling - Skips is an excellent bowling player. As seen in the episode "Skips Strikes" he is very good at bowling and he has many awards and trophies, which he burns in sorrow. He also has an album of his bowling memories.</li>
<li>Fixing Things - Skips is very well known for his ability to fix things (as seen in "Skips vs Technology") and he is the first person to be called whenever something needs fixing or building.</li>
<li>Magic Expert - Skips has been shown to be a superb spellcaster which uses to aid his friends in times of need.</li>
